Election season has started in Chefland and the election commission wants to know the count of eligible voters.

There are N people in Chefland where the age of the ith person in Ai.
Given that a person needs to be at least X years old to vote, find the number of eligible voters.

Input Format :

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X â€” the number of people in Chefland, and the minimum age required for a person to vote in Chefland.
The next line contains N space-separated integers, where the ith integer denotes the age of the ith person.

Output Format :

For each test case, output on a new line, the number of eligible voters in Chefland.
