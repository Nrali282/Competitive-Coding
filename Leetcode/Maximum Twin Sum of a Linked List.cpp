    ***********************************************************
In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

Example 1:

https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg1drawio.png
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 

Example 2:

https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg2drawio.png
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 

Example 3:

https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg3drawio.png
Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
